Very loosely based off of Sweet Home, Resident Evil 1, GU-L etc.

#### TODO:
```
- Fix AI animation freakout when going from facing NW -> N.
	- This seems to do 1 full rotation clockwise until facing north when. Might be an issue with how the animations are handled when calculating the degrees facing
- Fix game crashing when looking for new enemy after previously targetted enemy from last turn is kill
```
